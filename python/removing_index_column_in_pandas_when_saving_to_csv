# Removing index column in pandas when saving to csv file. 

When saving to csv format using pandas the csv will start with a new extra column that seems to be an index column of some sort. 
I do not need this, so I wanted to remove it. This is how it is done: 

``` python
# saving the result to csv without the index column
jobs.to_csv('my_new_file.csv', index = False)

```
