## Reading from CSV file using R 

This is how you read a csv file using R. 

``` {r}
setwd("~/dev/data") # Setting the working directory to ~/dev/data
data <- read.csv("data_in_csv.csv", header = TRUE) # reading the data file  

head(data) # displaying first few rows of data 
names(data) # displaying the column names 
dim(data) $ displaying the dimensions 
```
